# LibraryManager
Resource Center library manager application

This is a .Net application that uses a small, local SQL Engine DB to maintain a list of resources (books, CDs, DVDs) etc, borrowers and transactions for a small library. It was built for multi-lingual users, and allows you to easily switch between languages.
