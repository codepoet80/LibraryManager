# LibraryManager
Resource Center library manager application

This is a .Net application I wrote in 2010. It uses a small, local SQL Engine DB to maintain a list of resources (books, CDs, DVDs) etc, borrowers and transactions for a small library. It was built for disconnected environments, with multi-lingual users, and allows you to easily switch between languages. Barcode scanning is integrated with the cheap and hackable CueCat scanner.
In my free time, I'm working on updating the codebase to VS2013 so I can fix some bugs without using really old tools.
